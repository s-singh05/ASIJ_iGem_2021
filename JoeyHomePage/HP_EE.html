        <content>
            <p class="ex1">As part of our effort to increase awareness about breast cancer, we sent out an international survey (in Japanese and English) via Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and gathered over sixty responses. We gathered information on how much people knew about testing for breast cancer and conducted followup interviews with several of the individuals who responded.</p>
            <p class="ex1">Through the survey, we were able to identify several trends with respondents’ basic knowledge regarding breast cancer and breast cancer screening. Despite nearly half (45.9%) of our respondents having at least one close acquaintance or family member with breast cancer, only 23% of respondents ever received breast cancer screening in their lifetime. With regards to knowledge about breast cancer screening, only 27.9% correctly replied that breast cancer testing should occur after around 40 years of age, while only 29.5% of respondents knew that breast cancer testing should occur about once every 2 years.</p>

            <p class="ex1">When given multiple choices for what factors have prevented or would prevent respondents from getting screened for breast cancer, “Cost” and being “Too busy” were selected as the most common responses (44.3% and 42.6% respectively), followed by “Inconvenience” and “Lack of understanding of the risks of breast cancer screening” (both 39.3%). Other factors repeatedly mentioned in the free response section of the survey included the pain associated with breast cancer screening, as well as a reluctance to engage with the Japanese medical system (in some cases, due to bad past experiences with government-sponsored screenings).</p>
            <p class="ex1">Finally, in order to determine if there would be a demand for an easy at-home breast cancer detection test, we asked respondents whether they would be more willing to test frequently, or at all, if there were such a test. The answers to this question were overwhelmingly positive, with 95.1% responding “yes”.</p>

        <content>
            <p class="ex1">As part of our effort to educate others—especially younger children—about biology, members of our iGEM team joined the CSI class in ASIJ’s Summer Passport program. During this class, we assisted in a lab involving the extraction of DNA filaments from a banana. Before conducting the lab, Summer Passport and iGEM student members taught the middle school students in the CSI class about the molecular structure of DNA, as well as other basic knowledge about genetics.</p>

          <p class="ex1">The purpose of our promotional video is to inform others about why the 2021 ASIJ iGEM team chose to focus on breast cancer detection, what we intend to create to address its prevalence in the Japanese community, and how we plan to implement our design. We use animated drawings to represent statistics on awareness, delineate the issue with current mainstream detection mechanisms, and illustrate our ABCD design.</p>

          </div>
            <p class="ex1">This year, we distributed two pamphlets around Tokyo: one about breast cancer awareness, and another about who we are as an iGEM team and what we aim to accomplish. We distributed both of our pamphlets in classrooms at ASIJ as well as around Tokyo, handing them out at train stations in Shibuya, Futakotamagawa, Musashi-sakai, Yoga, Hanzomon, Sakurashinmachi, Toranomon Hills, Kichijoji and Roppongi</p>
            <p class="ex1">Our awareness pamphlet sheds light on how common breast cancer is in Japan, and provides insight into current breast cancer detection methods. It includes information about the symptoms and risk factors for breast cancer, how often individuals should get tested for breast cancer, how much testing costs, and how women can conduct self-exams at home. </p>
            <p class="ex1">Our iGEM informational pamphlet is specific to our team and project. In it, we describe what iGEM is, why we chose to focus on breast cancer, our plan, and information about our team. We also decided to include a word bank for more uncommon words or concepts because we want our pamphlets to be accessible to everyone.
