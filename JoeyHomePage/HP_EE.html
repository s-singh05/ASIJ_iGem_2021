        <content>
            <p class="ex1">The BCA Month is a month-long campaign project organized by iGEM and two other ASIJ clubs—Pre-Medical Society and Fight On!—aimed at spreading education and awareness for breast cancer to members of our local Japanese community. Through this deep collaboration between three ASIJ clubs, we hope to hold a continuous awareness campaign that targets beyond just students and families, but also the faculty, staff, and other associated members of our Japanese community. Multiple on-campus and virtual events are organized for the purpose of signifying the importance of breast cancer throughout the entire month of October, rather than limiting it to one date. </p>
            <p class="ex1">Each week, a short blurb and online pamphlet are distributed to the ASIJ community through the HS Bulletin and ASIJ Parent Newsletter. Weekly blurbs provide new information about breast cancer, specifically:</p>

            </div>
            <p class="ex1">A 2-minute animation video on breast cancer promotion created by our iGEM team has been displayed on the TV screens and monitors throughout the ASIJ Campus, starting October 1st, in hopes of engaging our full ASIJ community on this important topic. Our designed pamphlets targeting general educational information on breast cancer to outreach programs in Tokyo, Japan, will be printed into an official pamphlet by the ASIJ Communications Center and distributed to faculty members and all ES, MS, HS students to take home. A special quality about our pamphlets is that they aren't only in English. Our team has translated our pamphlets into multiple language versions, including Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Filipino. Although most awareness projects target students and families, we've noticed that our staff and hard-working cleaners at our school are barely targeted as key audiences, and there is a lack of information that goes out to them. As most of our cleaners and staff do not speak Japanese or English, our translated pamphlets will be accessible to them so that breast cancer awareness engages everyone on our campus, not just those who speak English.</p>
            <p class="ex1">Additionally, our clubs' members have designed multiple posters on relevant breast cancer topics like detection and outreach programs that will be posted around the school campus throughout October. We have ordered pink ribbons, which we will cut into breast cancer ribbons and combine with a small pin, to distribute to people in our community. iGEM, Pre-Med, and Fight On! members will be wearing the pin the entire month, to have a small physical reminder about the importance of breast cancer. Pink masks will also be distributed to our faculty members in all divisions, including the Elementary School, Middle School, High School, and Early Learning Center(Pre-K).</p>
            <p class="ex1">Two on-campus booths are organized. On October 14th, we will be having an Educational/Awareness Outreach Booth held at our ASIJ Courtyard. It will feature presentations from our members, interactive activities, and most importantly our guest speaker— Ms. Sakiko Suzuki from RTFC Japan, which is a breast cancer organization in Japan. We will display breast cancer models and other interactive activities for students and faculty to pass by and play with. On October 15th, we will organize an all school Pink Out day, where everyone will come to school wearing pink to show awareness. On October 27th, we will have our second booth at the courtyard.</p>

        <p id="surveys" class="ex2">Breast Cancer Awareness Survey and Interviews</p>
        <content>
            <p class="ex1">As part of our effort to increase awareness about breast cancer, we sent out an international survey (in Japanese and English) via Instagram, Twitter and Facebook and gathered over sixty responses. We gathered information on how much people knew about testing for breast cancer and conducted followup interviews with several of the individuals who responded.</p>
            <p class="ex1">Through the survey, we were able to identify several trends with respondents’ basic knowledge regarding breast cancer and breast cancer screening. Despite nearly half (45.9%) of our respondents having at least one close acquaintance or family member with breast cancer, only 23% of respondents ever received breast cancer screening in their lifetime. With regards to knowledge about breast cancer screening, only 27.9% correctly replied that breast cancer testing should occur after around 40 years of age, while only 29.5% of respondents knew that breast cancer testing should occur about once every 2 years.</p>

            <p class="ex1">When given multiple choices for what factors have prevented or would prevent respondents from getting screened for breast cancer, “Cost” and being “Too busy” were selected as the most common responses (44.3% and 42.6% respectively), followed by “Inconvenience” and “Lack of understanding of the risks of breast cancer screening” (both 39.3%). Other factors repeatedly mentioned in the free response section of the survey included the pain associated with breast cancer screening, as well as a reluctance to engage with the Japanese medical system (in some cases, due to bad past experiences with government-sponsored screenings).</p>
            <p class="ex1">Finally, in order to determine if there would be a demand for an easy at-home breast cancer detection test, we asked respondents whether they would be more willing to test frequently, or at all, if there were such a test. The answers to this question were overwhelmingly positive, with 95.1% responding “yes”.</p>

        <content>
            <p class="ex1">As part of our effort to educate others—especially younger children—about biology, members of our iGEM team joined the CSI class in ASIJ’s Summer Passport program. During this class, we assisted in a lab involving the extraction of DNA filaments from a banana. Before conducting the lab, Summer Passport and iGEM student members taught the middle school students in the CSI class about the molecular structure of DNA, as well as other basic knowledge about genetics.</p>

          <p class="ex1">The purpose of our promotional video is to inform others about why the 2021 ASIJ iGEM team chose to focus on breast cancer detection, what we intend to create to address its prevalence in the Japanese community, and how we plan to implement our design. We use animated drawings to represent statistics on awareness, delineate the issue with current mainstream detection mechanisms, and illustrate our ABCD design.</p>

            <p class="ex1">This year, we distributed two pamphlets around Tokyo: one about breast cancer awareness, and another about who we are as an iGEM team and what we aim to accomplish. We distributed both of our pamphlets in classrooms at ASIJ as well as around Tokyo, handing them out at train stations in Shibuya, Futakotamagawa, Musashi-sakai, Yoga, Hanzomon, Sakurashinmachi, Toranomon Hills, Kichijoji and Roppongi</p>
            <p class="ex1">Our awareness pamphlet sheds light on how common breast cancer is in Japan, and provides insight into current breast cancer detection methods. It includes information about the symptoms and risk factors for breast cancer, how often individuals should get tested for breast cancer, how much testing costs, and how women can conduct self-exams at home. </p>
            <p class="ex1">Our iGEM informational pamphlet is specific to our team and project. In it, we describe what iGEM is, why we chose to focus on breast cancer, our plan, and information about our team. We also decided to include a word bank for more uncommon words or concepts because we want our pamphlets to be accessible to everyone.
